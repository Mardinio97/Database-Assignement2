{"body":"&gt;  i can only repeat that contrary to what you're assuming, you do need explicit permission to alter the author's license offer\r\n\r\nAnd I can only repeat that there is not some magical \"license offer\" document here, and that modifying the file as permitted by one of the licenses does not constitute \"re-licensing\", does not constitute \"removing the license\" and does not constitute \"changing the license\". The license under which you received the software was one of:\r\n\r\n1. The BSD license, or\r\n2. The GNU GPL, version 2.\r\n\r\nNo other terms can apply. No other restrictions can apply. The only terms which apply are those of the license you accept.\r\n\r\nAgain: read what I've written about the consequences of this. The barest minimum consequence which can come out of your argument is that, despite the offer of GPL, it's not legal for anyone to distribute the software under GPL; your magical immutable license offer which must be passed on would constitute a restriction not present in the terms of the GPL, and thus any GPL distributor who passes on a requirement to preserve it would breach the GPL in so doing.\r\n\r\nThe further consequence of this would be that it is not possible for _any_ piece of software, originally offered under a choice of BSD or GPL by the author, to be legally distributed under the GPL by any licensee.\r\n\r\nAre you truly arguing for, and prepared to accept, that consequence?

It also does a useful trade keeping Burma's military rulers and their cronies afloat.\r\n\r\nMuch attention is placed on China and its coming hosting of the Olympic Games as a diplomatic pressure point on the rampant Burmese junta. But there is a group of government businessmen-technocrats in Singapore who will also be closely monitoring the brutality in Rangoon. And, were they so inclined, their influence could go a long way to limiting the misery being inflicted on Burma's 54 million people.\r\n\r\nCollectively known as \"Singapore Inc\", they gather around the $A150 billion state-owned investment house Temasek Holdings, controlled by a member of the ruling Lee family.\r\n\r\nWith an estimated $A3 billion staked in the country (and a more than $20 billion stake in Australia), Singapore Inc companies have been some of the biggest investors in and supporters of Burma's military junta \u2014 this while its Government, on the rare times it is asked, suggests a softly-softly diplomatic approach towards the junta.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Burma, Singapore pockets the high morals it likes to wave at the West elsewhere. Singapore's one-time head of foreign trade once said as his country was building links with Burma in the mid-1990s: \"While the other countries are ignoring it, it's a good time for us to go in \u2026 you get better deals, and you're more appreciated \u2026 Singapore's position is not to judge them and take a judgemental moral high ground.\"\r\n\r\nBut by providing Burma's pariah junta with the crucial equipment mostly denied by Western sanctions, Singapore has helped keep the junta and its cronies afloat for 20 years, since the last time the generals killed the citizens they are supposed to protect.\r\n\r\nWithdraw that financial support and Burma's junta would be substantially weakened, perhaps even fail. But after two decades of profitable business with the trigger-happy generals and their cronies, that's about the last thing Singapore is likely to do. There's too much money to be made.\r\n\r\nHotels, airlines, military materiel and training, crowd control equipment and sophisticated telecoms-monitoring devices for its secret police \u2014 Singapore is manager and supplier to the junta, and the \"cronified\" economy it controls.\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to spend any time in Burma and not make the junta richer, thanks to Singapore suppliers' contracts with the tourism industry. Singapore's hospitals also keep Burma's leaders alive \u2014 74-year-old junta leader Than Shwe has been getting his intestinal cancer treated in a Singapore government hospital, protected by Singapore security. Singapore's boutiques keep junta wives and families cloaked in Armani, and its banks help launder their money and that of Burma's crony drug lords.\r\n\r\nMuch of Singapore's activity in Burma has been documented by an analyst working in Prime Minister John Howard's direct chain of command, in the Office of National Assessments. Andrew Selth is recognised as an authority on the Burmese military. Now a research fellow at Queensland's Griffith University, Mr Selth has written extensively on how close Singapore is to the junta.\r\n\r\nOften writing as \"William Ashton\" in the authoritative Jane's Intelligence Review, Mr Selth has described in various articles how Singapore has sent the junta guns, rockets, armoured personnel carriers and grenade launchers, some of it trans-shipped from stocks seized by Israel from Palestinians in southern Lebanon.\r\n\r\nSingaporean companies have provided computers and networking equipment for Burma's defence ministry and army, while upgrading the bunkered junta's ability to network with regional commanders \u2014 so crucial as protesting monks take to the streets of 20 Burmese cities, causing major logistical headaches for the Tatmadaw, the Burmese military.\r\n\r\n\"Singapore cares little about human rights, in particular the plight of the ethnic and religious minorities in Burma,\" Mr Selth writes.\r\n\r\n\"Having developed one of the region's most advanced armed forces and defence industrial support bases, Singapore is in a good position to offer Burma a number of inducements which other ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) countries would find hard to match.\"\r\n\r\nSingapore's Foreign Minister, George Yeo, is the current chairman of ASEAN.\r\n\r\nMr Selth says Singapore also provided the equipment for a \"cyber war centre\" to monitor dissident activity while training Burma's secret police, whose sole job seems to be ensuring pro-democracy groups are crushed.\r\n\r\nMonitoring dissidents is an area where Singapore has particular expertise. After almost five decades in power, the Lee family-controlled People's Action Party ranks behind only the communists of China, Cuba and North Korea in leadership longevity, skilled in neutralising opposition.\r\n\r\n\"This centre is reported to be closely involved in the monitoring and recording of foreign and domestic telecommunications, including the satellite telephone conversations of Burmese opposition groups,\" Mr Selth writes.\r\n\r\nSingapore Government companies, such as leading arms supplier Singapore Technologies, dominate the communications and military sector in Singapore. \"It is highly unlikely,\" Mr Selth writes, \"that any of these arms shipments to Burma could have been made without the knowledge and support of the Singapore Government.\"\r\n\r\nHe notes that Singapore's ambassadors to Burma have included a former senior Singapore armed forces officer, and a past director of Singapore's defence-oriented Joint Intelligence Directorate, people with a military background rather than professional diplomats.\r\n\r\nHe writes that after the 1988 crackdown, when the junta killed 3000 protesters, \"the first country to come to the regime's rescue was in fact Singapore\".\r\n\r\nWhen I interviewed Singapore Technologies chief executive Peter Seah at his office in Singapore, I asked about the scale model of an armoured personnel carrier made by his company on his office table. He said ST sold the vehicles \"only to allies\".\r\n\r\nDoes that include Burma, I asked, given that Singapore controversially helped sponsor the military regime into ASEAN?\r\n\r\nMr Seah was non-specific: \"We only sell to allies and we make sure they are responsible.\" He didn't say how. ST and Temasek don't respond to questions about their activities in Burma.\r\n\r\nSingapore is so close to Burma that one of its diplomats there wrote a handbook for its business people there. Matthew Sim's Myanmar on my Mind is full of useful tips for Singaporean business people in Burma. \"A little money goes a long way in greasing the wheels of productivity,\" he writes.\r\n\r\nA chapter headed \"Committing Manslaughter when Driving\" describes the appropriate action if a Singaporean businessman accidentally kills a Burmese pedestrian. \"Firstly, the international businessman could give the family of the deceased some money as compensation and dissuade them from pressing charges. Secondly, he could pay a Myanmar citizen to take the blame by declaring that he was the driver in the fatal accident. An international businessman should not make the mistake of trying to argue his case in a court of law when it comes to a fatal accident, even if he is in the right.\"\r\n\r\nMr Sim says many successful Myanmar businessmen have opened shell companies in Singapore \"with little or no staff, used to keep funds overseas\". The companies are used to keep business deals outside the control of Burma's central bank, enabling Singaporeans and others to transact with Burma in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe may be referring to junta cronies such as Tay Za and the drug lord Lo Hsing Han. Lo is an ethnic Chinese, from Burma's traditionally Chinese-populated and opium-rich Kokang region in the country's east, bordering China. He controls a massive heroin empire, and one of Burma's biggest companies, Asia World, which the US Drug Enforcement Agency describes as a front for his drug-trafficking. Asia World controls toll roads, industrial parks and trading companies. Singapore is the Lo family's crucial window to the world, as it controls a number of companies there. His son Steven, who has been denied a visa to the US because of his links to the drug trade, married a Singaporean, Cecilia Ng, and the two reportedly control Singapore-based trading house Kokang Singapore.\r\n\r\nA former assistant secretary of state for the US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Robert Gelbard, has said that half Singapore's investment in Burma has \"been tied to the family of narco-trafficker Lo Hsing Han\".\r\n\r\nEric Ellis is an Australian journalist and correspondent in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n============================================\r\n\" ...'The videos and photographs of what is happening on the streets of Yangon and other cities in Myanmar have evoked the revulsion of the people throughout South-east Asia and all over the world,' (Singapore Prime Minister Lee) said, noting that the junta's actions had implications not just for the country, but also Asean and the region.\" \r\nSingapore daily, Straits Times, 1 Oct 2007\r\n\r\nlink: \r\nhttp://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_162941.html","link_id":"t3_2v2xn","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq"}

Andrew Selth is recognised as an authority on the Burmese military. Now a research fellow at Queensland's Griffith University, Mr Selth has written extensively on how close Singapore is to the junta.\r\nOften writing as \"William Ashton\" in the authoritative Jane's Intelligence Review, Mr Selth has described in various articles how Singapore has sent the junta guns, rockets, armoured personnel carriers and grenade launchers, some of it trans-shipped from stocks seized by Israel from Palestinians in southern Lebanon.\r\nSingaporean companies have provided computers and networking equipment for Burma's defence ministry and army, while upgrading the bunkered junta's ability to network with regional commanders \u2014 so crucial as protesting monks take to the streets of 20 Burmese cities, causing major logistical headaches for the Tatmadaw, the Burmese military.\r\n\"Singapore cares little about human rights, in particular the plight of the ethnic and religious minorities in Burma,\" Mr Selth writes.\r\n\"Having developed one of the region's most advanced armed forces and defence industrial support bases, Singapore is in a good position to offer Burma a number of inducements which other ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) countries would find hard to match.\"\r\nSingapore's Foreign Minister, George Yeo, is the current chairman of ASEAN.\r\nMr Selth says Singapore also provided the equipment for a \"cyber war centre\" to monitor dissident activity while training Burma's secret police, whose sole job seems to be ensuring pro-democracy groups are crushed.\r\nMonitoring dissidents is an area where Singapore has particular expertise. After almost five decades in power, the Lee family-controlled People's Action Party ranks behind only the communists of China, Cuba and North Korea in leadership longevity, skilled in neutralising opposition.\r\n\"This centre is reported to be closely involved in the monitoring and recording of foreign and domestic telecommunications, including the satellite telephone conversations of Burmese opposition groups,\" Mr Selth writes.\r\nSingapore Government companies, such as leading arms supplier Singapore Technologies, dominate the communications and military sector in Singapore. \"It is highly unlikely,\" Mr Selth writes, \"that any of these arms shipments to Burma could have been made without the knowledge and support of the Singapore Government.\"\r\nHe notes that Singapore's ambassadors to Burma have included a former senior Singapore armed forces officer, and a past director of Singapore's defence-oriented Joint Intelligence Directorate, people with a military background rather than professional diplomats.\r\nHe writes that after the 1988 crackdown, when the junta killed 3000 protesters, \"the first country to come to the regime's rescue was in fact Singapore\".\r\nWhen I interviewed Singapore Technologies chief executive Peter Seah at his office in Singapore, I asked about the scale model of an armoured personnel carrier made by his company on his office table. He said ST sold the vehicles \"only to allies\".\r\nDoes that include Burma, I asked, given that Singapore controversially helped sponsor the military regime into ASEAN?\r\nMr Seah was non-specific: \"We only sell to allies and we make sure they are responsible.\" He didn't say how. ST and Temasek don't respond to questions about their activities in Burma.\r\nSingapore is so close to Burma that one of its diplomats there wrote a handbook for its business people there. Matthew Sim's Myanmar on my Mind is full of useful tips for Singaporean business people in Burma. \"A little money goes a long way in greasing the wheels of productivity,\" he writes.\r\nA chapter headed \"Committing Manslaughter when Driving\" describes the appropriate action if a Singaporean businessman accidentally kills a Burmese pedestrian. \"Firstly, the international businessman could give the family of the deceased some money as compensation and dissuade them from pressing charges. Secondly, he could pay a Myanmar citizen to take the blame by declaring that he was the driver in the fatal accident. An international businessman should not make the mistake of trying to argue his case in a court of law when it comes to a fatal accident, even if he is in the right.\"\r\nMr Sim says many successful Myanmar businessmen have opened shell companies in Singapore \"with little or no staff, used to keep funds overseas\". The companies are used to keep business deals outside the control of Burma's central bank, enabling Singaporeans and others to transact with Burma in Singapore.\r\nHe may be referring to junta cronies such as Tay Za and the drug lord Lo Hsing Han. Lo is an ethnic Chinese, from Burma's traditionally Chinese-populated and opium-rich Kokang region in the country's east, bordering China. He controls a massive heroin empire, and one of Burma's biggest companies, Asia World, which the US Drug Enforcement Agency describes as a front for his drug-trafficking. Asia World controls toll roads, industrial parks and trading companies. Singapore is the Lo family's crucial window to the world, as it controls a number of companies there. His son Steven, who has been denied a visa to the US because of his links to the drug trade, married a Singaporean, Cecilia Ng, and the two reportedly control Singapore-based trading house Kokang Singapore.\r\nA former assistant secretary of state for the US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Robert Gelbard, has said that half Singapore's investment in Burma has \"been tied to the family of narco-trafficker Lo Hsing Han\".\r\nEric Ellis is an Australian journalist and correspondent in South-East Asia.\r\n============================================ \" ...'The videos and photographs of what is happening on the streets of Yangon and other cities in Myanmar have evoked the revulsion of the people throughout South-east Asia and all over the world,' (Singapore Prime Minister Lee) said, noting that the junta's actions had implications not just for the country, but also Asean and the region.\" Singapore daily, Straits Times, 1 Oct 2007\r\nlink: http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_162941.html\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_2v6u7","subreddit":"politics","score":2,"ups":2,"created_utc":1191197437,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"seletarmed","id":"c2v6ut","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_2v6u7","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473776121}

But that's a separate topic and you cannot ban a procedure completely because it is possible to apply to circumstances that are not allowed... you ban it in those circumstances. This said I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing even though it of course raises ethical concerns. But thing to keep in mind is the to fetus is not considered to be human not because it is \"retarded\", but because it is not yet viable. Therefore it can be argued that the reasons for having an abortion should not be regulated and allow this \"artificial selection\". I'm not sure how I stand on this... certainly under medical recommendations for serious health concerns it should be acceptable at least. But would doctors have recommended that Steven Hawking be aborted for example? It certainly a very emotional issue and I think one on which we do not have enough information to make good judgements on, at least for now. But banning abortion altogether to avoid the issue strikes me as putting our head in sand as the law will not be respected and it kills or shifts the public debate so people will act without having considered the ethical issues as much.\r\n\r\n&gt; I don't advocate changing any laws... that's a fool's strategy.\r\n\r\nThat's strange. Laws get changed all the time, the context of this thread is Ron Paul wanting to pass a Law to revoke overrule Roe vs. Wade and prevent the SCOTUS from interpreting the law on this issue which I think is very wrong and unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n&gt; Leave it the way it is now, focus on the things that matter. Reducing poverty, eliminating rape, making sure everyone has anonymous and free access to contraceptives. Anyone who thinks there is any other way really just wants to punish women who already have it bad.\r\n\r\nNow you are talking! Could not agree more. Except I would have said eliminating poverty and reducing rape. I think only evolution can eliminate rape over time if it is repressed and makes you less like to be able to reproduce. But that takes ages... and this is one of the reason abortion is important, we can't realistically eliminate rape completely even in the long term. Poverty on the other hand is social and can be eliminated. Doing so would reduce the rate of births of also the rate of infant mortality, child suffering and abuse as well as surpopulation. Ultimately that is why I support abortion: I do not want there to be unwanted children, especially not in Ron Paul's \"libertarian\" \"utopia\". No one should be able to force a woman to have a child, the stakes are just too high.

Laws get changed all the time, the context of this thread is Ron Paul wanting to pass a Law to revoke overrule Roe vs. Wade and prevent the SCOTUS from interpreting the law on this issue which I think is very wrong and unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nWell, he's wrong on this issue. But again, as I've said elsewhere... making it a state issue means that outlawing it has to happen in all 15 or 20 nearby states before it becomes unavailable. Whether Ron Paul hasn't thought that part through, or considers it a just solution, I can't be sure, but it hurts less than some would claim.\r\n\r\n&gt; I think only evolution can eliminate rape over time if it is repressed and makes you less like to be able to reproduce. But that takes ages... and this is one of the reason abortion is important, we can't realistically eliminate rape completely even in the long term.\r\n\r\nEliminate was too strong a word. I believe I read the other day that there are 300,000 rapes each year, and that a 12th of them end up pregnant, 25,000 of them. If half undergo abortions, that's 12,000 that could be prevented each year with no controversey whatsoever. \r\n\r\nEven if you could only reduce incidence of rape by half, that's still alot.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if improvement enforcement after the fact is the best approach, or if some sort of social program to make it easier to report rape, a combination of both, or something else entirely is in order. But it's a solvable problem.\r\n\r\n&gt; Ultimately that is why I support abortion: I do not want there to be unwanted children\r\n\r\nI agree with that... but there's got to be a better way than waiting until you're already 3 months into the process.\r\n\r\n&gt; No one should be able to force a woman to have a child, the stakes are just too high.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, considering that one is a direct consequence of something months in the past, we're either talking rape or someone being irresponsible. Again though, it makes no sense to outlaw abortion, to punish that woman and a doctor after the fact. Few are as callous or unemotional as the anecdotes like to claim. But if it's a situation with no good choices, let's do something about it before it gets that far.\r\n\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473776124,"gilded":0,"id":"c2v6zg","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c2v6vm","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoMoreNicksLeft"}

{"body":"I think it goes further than that.  Catholicism, like many other religions, is a follow-the-leader religion.  The massive structure of the Church, reflected in its architectural wonders, art, history, and large and diverse group of followers provide a feeling of security for one's belief.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Evangelicals are highly individualistic.  They believe that the Bible is God's (only) word, and that God speaks directly to them through the Bible.  If their personal interpretation of the Bible disagrees with whatever religious \"leader\" is in favor with the political and economic authorites, they feel perfectly free to go off and believe whatever they believe, and choose whatever leader echoes their beliefs.  There is no Vatican or Mecca or other geographic power center to which they look, and there are almost uncountable subgroups of the Protestant/Evangelical Christians.\r\n\r\nHence the rise of televangelism, which uses the same marketing techniques to attract followers that your favorite brand of beer, toothpaste, automobile, or whatever product uses to attract you.  The Bible-believers are seduced into believing that what their Bible-thumping leader wants them to think is what they themselves find in the Bible.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Bible-thumping leaders, like the majority of other religious leaders, seek raw power and they use their army of followers to that end.  But they have to deal with the fact that if their followers find a more seductive, more charismatic leader who markets himself as a better interlocutor of God's biblical messages, they'll switch in a Texan minute.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_2v0v9","subreddit":"science","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1191199088,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"mexicodoug","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c2v44j","id":"c2v724","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473776125}

The \"spooky\" thing is just well-established shorthand for a certain observable effect.  Yes, it derives from a classical view (Einstein's, in fact), but it's not intended as either explanatory or anti-explanatory when it's used nowadays.  It's just a term, with an established meaning.  \r\n\r\nThe \"no hope of understanding\" part arises from the fears of people who aren't willing to accept the results of simple experiments.  If you don't like the EPR paradox, what do you say to the dual-slit experiment?\r\n\r\n&gt; The reality of science is that greater than 90% of scientists are mindless plodders incapable of actually understanding their own subject field.\r\n\r\nThat's the reality of all human endeavours.  It's the people in the top percentiles who typically make the breakthroughs, and it's their results that are chewed over and often misunderstood by the rest.  But somehow, we tend to muddle through and agree on workable theories, theories which match predictions and have some explanatory power.  We make mistakes along the way but as long as we're dealing with theories that are falsifiable (i.e. ignore string theory for now), we tend to catch a lot of those mistakes eventually.\r\n\r\nSometimes, science is indeed driven forward by people with an agenda, people who want a particular result; but in the long run, that only works when the agenda matches what's observable.  Agendas have a way of failing in the face of the scientific method, as Einstein discovered when he attempted to disprove spooky action.  So if you're pursuing that sort of agenda, you have to at least recognize that you've decided on an outcome ahead of the evidence, and - if you're a scientist - you're going to want to be careful that this doesn't skew your thinking too badly, and you just won't get anywhere.\r\n\r\nIt's obviously impossible to capture the entirety of the scientific method in a comment on reddit - you can read Kuhn and Feyerabend et al until you're blue in the face and still not have a good handle on it, but you can also step back and look at what actually happens.  Science is a human activity - to say it \"approximates science in some crude sense\" completely misunderstands what science is.  Science is what it is, it doesn't approximate it.  Perhaps you mean to say something like \"science approximates reality, or truth, in some crude sense\", if you're a realist, that is.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry you're so angry about all this, but I can't really help you since you haven't actually described your position.    \r\n\r\nAddendum:\r\n\r\nI know what my position is, and I can defend it.  Can you say the same?  If so, you haven't demonstrated it so far.  You imply in the parent comment that you perhaps accept some sort of quantum reality, and you're not impressed by some classical perspectives. But in your first reply to me, you referenced Marmet who was trying support a classical perspective.  Without further explanation, this is somewhat contradictory.\r\n\r\nYou also talk about the \"wavefunction isn't real\" crowd, but I'm not sure if you're referring to the Copenhagen interpretation, or the work on decoherence - which seems fairly rational - or some more fundamental denial that I might not agree with either.  If you're going to rail against me, the least you could do is describe what you believe.\r\n"}

When they returned for this purpose all that was\r\navailable for taking was what they were owed, so stealing was not an option. Instead, middlemen\r\nfrequently renewed the credit agreement, which initiated a subsequent round of credit-based trade,\r\nand so on.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","link_id":"t3_2v3u4","stickied":false,"subreddit":"politics","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1191202130}
